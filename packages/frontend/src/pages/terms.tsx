    <h1>Circulate.Social Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <h2>1. OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>
      This Circulate.Social Terms of Service Agreement (this
      &quot;Agreement&quot;) is entered into by and between Circulate.Social
      (&quot;Circulate.Social&quot;) and you, and is made effective as of the
      date of your use of this website (&quot;Site&quot;) or the date of
      electronic acceptance. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions
      of your use of Circulate.Social services (the &quot;Services&quot;), and
      represents the entire agreement between you and Circulate.Social
      concerning the subject matter hereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your electronic acceptance of this Agreement signifies that you have read,
      understand, acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Agreement, along
      with our Universal Terms of Service Agreement, which is incorporated
      herein by this reference, and any other agreements or policies that are
      expressly incorporated herein.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot; shall refer to
      Circulate.Social. The terms &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;,
      &quot;User&quot; or &quot;customer&quot; shall refer to any individual or
      entity who accepts this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
      deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, change or modify this
      Agreement, any policies or agreements which are incorporated herein, and
      any limits or restrictions on the Services, at any time, and such changes
      or modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting to this Site.
      Your use of the Services after such changes or modifications shall
      constitute your acceptance of this Agreement and any limitations to the
      Services as last revised. If you do not agree to be bound by this
      Agreement and any Service limitations as last revised, do not continue to
      use the Services. We may occasionally notify you of changes or
      modifications to this Agreement by email. It is therefore very important
      that you keep your shopper account information current. We assume no
      liability or responsibility for your failure to receive an email
      notification if such failure results from an inaccurate email address.
    </p>
    <h2>2. SERVICES</h2>
    <p>
      Circulate.Social Services (the &quot;Service&quot;) allows users to create
      groups of people to curate event newsletters and submit events.
    </p>
    <p>All plan prices are subject to change at any time.</p>
    <p>
      It is understood that Circulate.Social makes no guarantee that HTML
      messages will be rendered properly on all recipients&apos; email programs,
      due to the wide variety of HTML generation tools available.
      Circulate.Social makes every attempt to make sure that all email messages
      sent through our servers follow email standards, but we cannot guarantee
      that messages will look consistent across all email platforms. For
      example, if you use Microsoft Word to generate HTML email messages, it is
      expected that recipients of your message using a non-Microsoft email
      application may have difficulty reading your message. For best results
      Circulate.Social recommends, but does not guarantee, the use of HTML
      editors that generate HTML that adheres to W3C standards.
    </p>

    <h2>3. ANTI-SPAM POLICY</h2>
    <p>
      By using Circulate.Social, you acknowledge and agree to not use the
      Services for spam, and you agree to comply with the provisions of the
      CAN-SPAM Act. We have a zero-tolerance spam policy. You acknowledge and
      agree that we may immediately terminate any account that we believe, in
      our sole and absolute discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise
      connected with any spam or other unsolicited bulk email activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content you include in any email must be accurate and you may only use
      the Services to send emails to customers and contacts who have expressly
      opted in or given you permission to send emails to them. If you do not
      have written proof that each recipient on your contact list has expressly
      opted in or given you permission to send emails to them, do not include
      them in any email marketing campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      We prohibit the use of third-party, purchased, rented, or harvested
      mailing lists. You shall not send emails (i) to newsgroups, message
      boards, distribution lists, or unsolicited email addresses, or (ii) to any
      recipient who has opted out, unsubscribed, or otherwise objected to
      receiving such emails from you or another party on whose behalf you may be
      commissioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      You represent and warrant that the information you use in any email
      marketing campaign, including the header, subject line, and content, is
      not false, deceptive, or misleading. You agree to include a valid and
      correct physical address, as well as a valid and correct &quot;from&quot;
      and &quot;reply to&quot; address in every email. You must be able to
      provide opt-in verification for each contact for each email marketing
      campaign. You must comply with all opt-out requests within ten (10)
      business days of receipt and the opt-out method used must be able to
      process opt-out requests for a minimum of sixty (60) days after the email
      is sent. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right but not the
      obligation to copy and/or store your contact lists, customer and contact
      information, and other information as needed. We shall not use this
      information in any way that violates our Privacy Policy, except as
      permitted or required by law.
    </p>
    <h2>4. PROHIBITED USE</h2>
    <p>
      You may not use Circulate.Social to send email campaigns that link to or
      display pornography, other sexually explicit content, illegal goods or
      services, content that promotes, encourages, or engages in terrorism or
      violence, pyramid schemes, chain letters, multi-level marketing campaigns,
      affiliate and network marketing materials, or any other content we deem
      inappropriate. You may not exploit Circulate.Social&apos;s service
      agreement by systematically uploading, sending, deleting, then replacing
      contacts in order to send to more unique email addresses than you&apos;re
      permitted for your service level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, some industries yield higher-than-normal abuse rates, which
      can negatively affect the deliverability for other Circulate.Social users.
      In order to maintain the highest possible delivery rates for all our
      users, Circulate.Social is unable to send on behalf of certain industries
      and senders. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pharmaceutical products</li>
      <li>
        Work from home, make money on online, and lead generation opportunities
      </li>
      <li>Online trading, day trading tips, or stock market-related content</li>
      <li>Gambling services, products, or tips</li>
      <li>Multi-level marketing (MLM)</li>
      <li>Affiliate marketing</li>
      <li>Credit repair and get out of debt opportunities</li>
      <li>Mortgage and loan content</li>
      <li>Nutritional, herbal, and vitamin supplements</li>
      <li>List brokers or list rental services</li>
      <li>
        Counterfeit or &quot;knock off&quot; products appearing to be another
        brand
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It is the responsibility of the sender to ensure that their content falls
      within these guidelines. Circulate.Social may monitor your account to
      ensure compliance with these terms and operation within the acceptable
      standards of the industry and of the email providers you are sending to.
    </p>

      versions shall have equal validity, (ii) each party acknowledges that it
      has reviewed both language versions and that they are substantially the
      same in all material respects, and (iii) in the event of any discrepancy
